    <p>One-Pan Ground Beef Stroganoff Noodles â€“ Helping Hamburger Help Itself

        Like most people who grew up during the Golden Age of processed food, my mom bought a fair amount of pre-packaged, pre-mixed, just-add-water type meals, but when it came to pasta or noodles in a ground meat sauce, her hamburger did not need any help. We did enjoy the occasional box of mac and cheese, or package of pop-tarts, but virtually all dishes like this ground beef stroganoff noodles were made from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>Hamburger Helper was something other moms who didn't know how to cook served their kids, and while that might have been a touch hypocritical, since she may have been making pancakes from a box while saying it, we were grateful. Having said all that, I've had Hamburger Helper, and didn't hate it, and the idea of a quick, easy, one-pan meal involving meaty sauce coved noodles was a great one. So, I decided to share this homage.

    </p>
    <p>There are many different shapes and sizes of egg noodles, so the one and only challenge with this recipe is their cooking time. Please just use my times as a guide, and keeping cooking, stirring occasionally, adding liquid as needed, until the noodles are perfect. Once they are, stir in the sour cream, and you're eating. If you add that before everything is done, it may split as it simmers. Other than that, not much can go wrong, and I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!
