    <h1>Garlic Noodles</h1>
    <p>These garlic noodles are deceivingly simple, yet devastatingly delicious. Garlic noodles were 
        invented back in the '70s at a restaurant in San Francisco called Thanh Long. Usually served with roasted Dungeness crab, 
        the recipe is a very closely guarded family secret, but after lots of investigation, 
        and even more experimentation, I think this is very close.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 table spoons soy suace</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire suace</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoons seasame oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Noodles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>6 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finley  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    <p>Stir soy sauce, oyster sauce, Worcestershire sauce, fish sauce,
         sesame oil, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl for the secret sauce.
    </p>
    <h5>step 2</h5>
    <p>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Quickly stir in the secret sauce and turn off the heat.

    </p>
    <h5>step 3</h5>
    <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet slightly firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.

    <h3>Chef's Notes:</h3>
    <p>Virtually any noodle will shine in this, but I quite like good old spaghetti. Good options include Chinese egg noodles and ramen.

    <p>Apparently, one of the secret ingredients is Maggi Seasoning Sauce, which I decided not to use since I'm not sure how easy it is for the average person to find. Besides, I think my assortment of savory, umami-rich substitutes did the job quite nicely, and everything in the ingredient list can be found at any large grocery store.</p>
